# display4OMV

Open Media Vault is a nice open-souce NAS project with any PC-based hardware.<br>
I added display to show some useful information such as disk usage, fan speed, network upload/download speed, etc.

Requirement
- Arduino module (I used Arduino Nano) connected to USB port
- 128x64 LCD display (I used 12864 OLED with SH1106 controller) - Any u8glib compatible display will be good.
